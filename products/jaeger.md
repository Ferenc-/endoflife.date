> [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) is an open-source distributed tracing platform used for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based architectures.

According to [Jaeger's Security Policy](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger?tab=security-ov-file#supported-versions), only the latest major release officially receives new features, bug fixes, and security updates.
However, as discussed in [this issue](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/6321), the Jaeger team may provide extended support for previous major versions too.
